Filter posts through multiple custom taxonomies

== Description ==

Say you have two custom taxnomies defined: genre and artist.

Currently, you can do the following types of queries on your site:

?genre=jazz

?genre=jazz&cat=1

But you can't do this:

?genre=jazz&artist=chet-baker

WordPress will just ignore one of the parameters.

This plugin fixes that.
